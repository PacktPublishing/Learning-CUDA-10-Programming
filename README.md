Learning CUDA 10 Programming, published by Packt
This is the code repository for [Learning CUDA 10 Programming]( https://www.packtpub.com/programming/learning-cuda-10-programming-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Do you want to write GPU-accelerated applications, but don't know how to get started? With CUDA 10, you can easily add GPU processing to your C and C++ projects. CUDA 10 is the de-facto framework used to develop high-performance, GPU-accelerated applications.
In this course, you will be introduced to CUDA programming through hands-on examples. CUDA provides a general-purpose programming model which gives you access to the tremendous computational power of modern GPUs, as well as powerful libraries for machine learning, image processing, linear algebra, and parallel algorithms.
After working through this course, you will understand the fundamentals of CUDA programming and be able to start using it in your applications right away.
